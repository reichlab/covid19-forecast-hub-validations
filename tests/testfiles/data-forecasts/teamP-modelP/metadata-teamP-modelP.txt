methods_long: "We estimate an econometric county panel data model based on the
  standard SIR model. The econometric model relates the change in log active (new) infections
  between now and some future horizon to the current transmission rate and the susceptible share
  of the population. The current transmission rate is assumed to be a function of individuals’
  mobility behavior and weather (temperature and precipitation). County level mobility is
  measured using the Mobility and Engagement Index (MEI) constructed by
  the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas from mobile device geolocation data
  provided by Safegraph. County level weather data comes from weather
  station readings on daily-high temperatures and precipitation from the
  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), following the
  methodology in Wilson (2019). For diseases that convey long-lasting
  immunity to those who have recovered from infection,
  the susceptible share is simply one minus the share of the local population
  that have previously been infected. We assume this share in a given county
  is proportional to cumulative confirmed cases to date as a share of the
  county’s population. This proportionality also implies that the change in
  log active infections can be proxied by the change in log active cases.
  Aside from mobility, weather, and accumulated natural immunity, there are two other
  important elements of the econometric model. The first is lagged infection growth,
  allowing for the possibility that lagged infection growth is predictive of subsequent
  infection growth. The second additional element is county-specific intercepts
  (fixed effects), which allow each county to have a different mean level of
  infection growth, independent of the other elements of the model."
